Keep the Map.udk and Team2Package.upk files up-to-date in that dropbox link!

Load the Map/Package in UDK:

1. Open UDK Editor, don't open the Map. It'll break references if you open the map before step 2.

2. Go to the Content Browser, choose open (near the bottom left of the window near the import button) and select the Team2Package.upk

3. Once imported you can open the map. 
 
When adding assets, make sure you add them to the Team2Package, and if they're part of a collection, use a Grouping. Its a pain to add them to the package after the fact, so do it right from the start.

Save the Map/Pacakge:

1. In the Content Browser, right-click the package and save it

2. Save the map (via the File Menu, this will take a while)

3. Upload both files to that same dropbox link
